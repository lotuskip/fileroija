fileroija is a small program to randomly select files from a directory tree. It
can be used for instance to select random songs from your music library.

Compile with:
	g++ -o fileroija fileroija.cpp -O2 -lpcrecpp
to support regular expressions (you will need the pcre library), or
	g++ -o fileroija fileroija.cpp -O2 -DNO_REGEXP
to disable them.

Usage:
	fileroija [directory] <regular expression (perl-type)> <-nosub>

Upon execution, fileroija will read the given directory, and, unless the
"-nosub" flag is given, recursively all the subdirectories and collect all
regular files (that match the given regular expression if one is given).
It will then report how many files it found. It needs to find at least 2 files
to function.

Note that the regular expression is only tested against the file names; it does
not consider directories!

Next, fileroija will wait for user input. If you enter a positive number,
fileroija will pick that many random files from the selected set and print
the filenames (with full paths) to stdout. The randomisation is designed so
that at least half of all the files must become picked once before any file
can be selected another time. By entering '0', you can force the memory of
previous picks to be cleared.

The idea is to pipe the stdout output for further processing, e.g. to your
favourite music player to create a playlist. Note that the filenames are
separated by newlines.

Enter ^C or ^D at any time to quit fileroija.
